# Wacha_Tucheze Supervised ML Project

The FIFA Men's World Ranking is a ranking system for men's national teams in association football. The teams of the men's member nations of FIFA, football's world governing body, are ranked based on their game results with the most successful teams being ranked highest. The rankings were introduced in December 1992.

A points system is used, with points being awarded based on the results of all FIFA-recognised full international matches. It is called the Elo rating system.

Elo ratings are a numerical way to rank the skill level of various competitors based on their performance as well as the relative skill level of their opponents. The idea is that beating a tougher opponent should give you more points than beating an easier opponent.

The study is meant to predict the number of scores made by both the away team and home teams.
